# Terminology

### Algorithm

* A set of rules that a machine follows to achieve a particular goal
* Example: Cooking recipe

### Machine Learning

* A set of methods that allow computers to learn from data to make/improve predictions

### Machine Learning Algorithm or Learner

* A program used to induce a machine learning model from data

### Machine Learning Model

* A learned program that maps inputs to predictions
* Represented as $$\hat{f}$$ or $$ \hat{f}(x)$$

### Black Box Model

* A system that does not reveal its internal mechanisms

### Dataset

* A table with the features and the target to predict

### Instance

* A row in the dataset,  $$x^{(i)}$$
* Also known as data point, example, observation

### Target

* The information the machine learns to predict, $$y_{i}$$

### Features

* Columns in the dataset
* The inputs used for prediction\(regression\) or classification
* Matrix of all features: $$X$$
* Single row/instance of features: $$x^{(i)}$$
* Vector of a single feature/column: $$x_j$$
* Single row, single feature: $$x_j^{(i)}$$

### Prediction

* What the **machine learning model** '_guesses_' what the **target** should be based on **features**
* Represented as $$ \hat{f}x^{(i)}$$ or $$\hat{y}$$
