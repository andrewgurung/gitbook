# Linear Algebra: Deep Learning Book

> Linear algebra is a form of continuous rather than discrete mathematics.

## Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors

## Multiplying Matrix and Vectors

## Identity and Inverse Matrix

#### Identity Matrix

* $$I_n \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$; where main diagonal = 1's and all other entries = 0's
* An identity matrix $$I_n$$ is a matrix that does not change any vector $$x$$ when we multiply that vector by that matrix. $$I_nx = x$$ 

#### Inverse Matrix

* Denoted by $$A^{-1}$$; where $$A^{-1}A = I_n$$
* Use case: $$A^{-1}$$ can be used to solve linear equations:

$$
Ax=b
\newline
Step \_1: Multiply \ by \  A^{-1}
\newline
A^{-1}Ax=A^{-1}b
\newline
Step \_2: A^{-1}A = I_n
\newline
I_nx = A^{-1}b
\newline
Step \_3: Multiplying\ with \ I_n \ will \ not \ change \ the \ vector
\newline
x = A^{-1}b
$$
