# Linear independence and Basis vectors

### Linearly dependent

A set of vectors is set to be **linearly dependent** if at least one of the vectors in the set can be defined as a linear combination of the others. 

**Linearly dependent** vectors may either overlap with each other or define the same plane. Such extra vector is not necessary to define a plane or space. Below is a relation between vectors **u, v and w** and scalars.

**u** = _a_**v** + _b_**w  \(3D space\)**  
**w** = _a_**v \(2D space\)**

### Linearly independent

If no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others, the vectors are said to be **linearly independent**. Below is a relation between vectors **u, v and w** and scalars.

**u** != _a_**v** + _b_**w  \(3D space\)**  
**w** != _a_**v \(2D space\)**

Two vectors **u** and **v** are **linearly independent** if the only numbers _a_ and _b_ satisfying _a_**u**+_b_**v** = 0 are \[a = b = 0\] \(known as trivial solution\)

## Basis vectors

**Basis vectors** are **lineary independent** vectors having the property that every vector in the space can be written uniquely as a linear combination of them. In other words, we can be scale basis vectors using scalars to reach all possible vectors in the given space.
