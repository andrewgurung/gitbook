# Types of Events

**Event** means one \(or more\) outcomes.

**An event with only one outcome:**  
- Getting a Tail when tossing a coin is an event  
- Rolling a "5" is an event.

**An event with several outcomes:**  
- Choosing a "King" from a deck of cards \(any of the 4 Kings\)  
- Rolling an "even number" \(2, 4 or 6\)

### Types of Events

#### **1. Independent**

* Each event is **NOT** affected by any other events
* Example: Toss a coin three times and it comes up 'Head' each time. What is the chance of 'Tail' in the next toss? Answer: It is always 50%. **Gambler's Fallacy:** 'A tail is due' or'Just one more go, my luck is due'

#### **2. Dependent**

* An event **can** be affected by **previous events**
* Also called **Conditional probability\***
* Example: Chance of drawing a King 1st Attempt: 4 out of 52
  * If 1st card **was** a King, 2nd card has **less** chances to be King. **3/51**
  * If 1st card was **NOT** a King, 2nd card has **more** chances to be King. **4/51**

#### **3. Mutually Exclusive**

* Events that can't happen at the same time
* Example: Heads and Tails are Mutually Exclusive

### Conditional Probability\*

A conditional probability is the probability of an event, given some other event has already occurred.  
Example: A ball hit the red shelf \(event A\), what's the probability it also hit the blue shelf \(event B\)? Refer to the visual explanation at [Setosa.io](http://setosa.io/conditional/)

$$
P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}
$$
