# Scott Adams: 80% of the rules of good writing

## The Day You Became A Better Writer

* The main technique is keeping things simple
* Prune your sentences
  * Avoid: He was **very** happy
  * Better: He was happy
* First sentence needs to grab the reader
* Write short sentences
* Put the **object** before the action
  * Avoid: The ball was hit by the **boy** _\(**object**\)_
  * Better: The **boy** hit the ball
