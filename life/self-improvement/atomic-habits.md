# Atomic Habits

### Four Laws of Behavior Change

1. Cue
2. Craving 
3. Response 
4. Reward

> Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

### The Habit Loop 

The **cue** triggers a **craving**, which motivates a **response**, which provides a **reward**, which satisfies the **craving** and, ultimately, becomes associated with the **cue** forming a _neurological feedback loop_.

> The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”

### How to Build a Habit 

1. **Cue**: Make it obvious 
2. **Craving**: Make it attractive 
3. **Response**: Make it easy 
4. **Reward**: Make it satisfying

> Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.

### How to Break a Habit \(Inversion\)

1. **Cue**: Make it invisible 
2. **Craving**: make it unattractive
3. **Response**: make it difficult 
4. **Reward**: make it unsatisfying

> Feeling motivated gets you to act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.
