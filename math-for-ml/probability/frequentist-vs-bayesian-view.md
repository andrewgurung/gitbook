# Frequentist vs Bayesian View

### Frequentist View

* Defines probability of some event in terms of the relative frequency with which the event tends to occur
* More widely used and usually involves simpler calculations
* Frequentists think **deductively**: "If the true population looks like this, then my sample might look like this."
* Terminology: p value, significant, null hypothesis, or confidence interval
* Draw conclusions strictly from what’s in that set of given data

### Bayesian View

* Defines probability in more subjective terms — as a measure of the strength of your belief regarding the true situation
* Requires powerful computers and sophisticated software
* Bayesians think **inductively**: "My sample came out like this, so the true situation might be this."
* Terminology: prior probability, noninformative priors, and credible intervals
* Broader view of "usable information" which typically starts with some prior probabilities \(based on previous experiments\) and then blend in the results of the latest experiment to revise those probabilities

#### **Note:**

* A **population** includes all of the elements from a set of data.
* A **sample** consists one or more observations drawn from the population.
