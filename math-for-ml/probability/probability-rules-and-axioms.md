# Probability Rules and Axioms

**Probability** is a way to **quantify the uncertainty** that arises from conducting experiments using a random sample from the population of interest.  
  
**Probability** of an event happening =  \(Number of ways it can happen\) / \(Total number of outcomes\)

**Example:** _the chances of rolling a '3' with a die_  
Number of ways it can happen: 1  
Total number of outcomes: 6  
So the Probability = 1/6

### Important terms

**Sample Space:** all the possible outcomes of an experiment  
**Sample Point:** just one of the possible outcomes  
**Event:** one **or more** outcomes of an experiment

Example: the chances of a "double" when rolling 2 dice.  
**Sample Space:** Possible outcomes. **36** **sample points**  
                           {1,1} {1,2} {1,3} {1,4} ... {6,3} {6,4} {6,5} {6,6}

**Event:** Looking for double. Event is made up of **6** **sample points.**  
                           {1,1} {2,2} {3,3} {4,4} {5,5} and {6,6}  
****  
Run 100 **Experiments**, and find how many **Events** you observe.

## Probability Rules

**Probability Rule One:** For any event A, 0 ≤ P\(A\) ≤ 1  
**Probability Rule Two:** The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1.  
**Probability Rule Three:** P\(not A\) = 1 – P\(A\)  
**Probability Rule Four:** If A and B are disjoint events, then P\(A or B\) = P\(A\) + P\(B\)

## Probability Axioms

**Axiom One:** The probability of an event is a non-negative real number that is greater than or equal to 0.  
**Axiom Two:** The probability of the entire sample space is one\(no events exist outside of the sample space\)  
**Axiom Three:**  If two events A and B are **mutually exclusive**, then the probability of either A or B \[i.e P\(A U B\)\] = P\(A\) + P\(B\)
