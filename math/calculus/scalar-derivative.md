# Scalar Derivative and Partial Derivatives

## Derivative

In calculus, **derivative** can be approached in two different ways. One is geometrical \(as a **slope of a curve**\) and the other one is physical \(as a **rate of change**\). ****The process of finding a **derivative** is called "**differentiation**"

**'The derivative of'** is commonly written as $$\frac{d}{dx}$$ or $$f'(x)$$

### Find a Derivative

#### Example:

$$f'(x)=\frac{d}{dx}x^2 = 2x$$

![](../../.gitbook/assets/slope_derivative_x2.png)

means the slope or "rate of change" at any point in the graph/function $$x^2$$  is **2x**. So when **x=2** the slope is **2x = 4**

## Partial Derivatives

A **partial derivative** of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant.

**'The partial derivative with respect to x'** is written as  $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$$ or $$f'_x$$where $${\partial}$$is called 'del' or 'curly dee'.

### Find Partial Derivatives

Consider a function with two variables \(x and y\): $$f(x,y) = x^2 + y^3$$ 

**a\) Partial derivative with respect to x** \(Treat y as a constant like a random number 12\)

$$
f'_x = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} =  2x+0=2x
$$

**b\) Partial derivative with respect to y** \(Treat x as a constant\)

$$
f'_y =\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}= 0+3y^2=3y^2
$$
