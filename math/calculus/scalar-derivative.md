# Scalar Derivative

In calculus, **derivative** can be approached in two different ways. One is geometrical \(as a **slope of a curve**\) and the other one is physical \(as a **rate of change**\). ****The process of finding a **derivative** is called "**differentiation**"

**'The derivative of'** is commonly written as $$\frac{d}{dx}$$ or $$f'(x)$$

### Find a Derivative

#### Example:

$$\frac{d}{dx}x^2 = 2x$$

![](../../.gitbook/assets/slope_derivative_x2.png)

means the slope or "rate of change" at any point in the graph/function $$x^2$$  is **2x**. So when **x=2** the slope is **2x = 4**
