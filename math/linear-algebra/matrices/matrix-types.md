# Matrix types

## Square Matrix

A matrix where the number of rows\(m\) equals to the number of columns\(n\).  
**Note**: The vector of values along the diagonal of the matrix from the top left to the bottom right is called the main diagonal.

$$
Square\hspace{0.1cm}Matrix\hspace{0.1cm}of\hspace{0.1cm}order\hspace{0.1cm}3;\hspace{0.1cm}A=\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} \hspace{0.2cm} a_{12} \hspace{0.2cm} a_{13}
\\ a_{21} \hspace{0.2cm} a_{22}\hspace{0.2cm} a_{23}
\\ a_{31} \hspace{0.2cm} a_{32}\hspace{0.2cm} a_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
