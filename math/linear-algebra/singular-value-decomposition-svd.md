# Singular-Value Decomposition\(SVD\)

Singular-Value Decomposition\(SVD\) is a matrix decomposition/factorization method for reducing a given matrix into its constituent elements.

**Note**: All matrices have an SVD, which makes it more stable than other methods, such as the eigendecomposition.

$$
A = U . \Sigma.V^T
$$

$$A$$:The real **m x n** matrix that we wish to decompose  
$$U$$: **m x m** matrix where matrix **U** is also known as **left-single vectors** of A  
$$\Sigma$$: **m x n** diagonal matrix where the diagonal values are known as **singular values**  
$$V^T$$: Transpose of an **n x n** matrix where matrix **V** is also **right-singular vectors** of A
