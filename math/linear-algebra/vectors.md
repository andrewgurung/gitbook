## **Scalars**

Scalars are single numbers.  
Eg: x âˆˆ R denotes that the scalar value x is a member of real valued numbers R.

## Vector

**Vector** in Machine Learning is a collection/array of numbers that corresponds to some features. 

Eg:  \[2,5,1\] may be used to classify an apple where the first, second and third values represent features such as size, color and number of seeds in a fruit respectively.

Vector in Python can be represented as a NumPy array.

```python
from numpy import array
v = array([2, 5, 1])
print(v)
```

```bash
## Output
[2 5 1]
```
