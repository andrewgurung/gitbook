# Probability Rules and Axioms

**Probability** of an event happening =  \(Number of ways it can happen\) / \(Total number of outcomes\)

**Example:** _the chances of rolling a '3' with a die_  
Number of ways it can happen: 1  
Total number of outcomes: 6  
So the Probability = 1/6

### Important terms

**Sample Space:** all the possible outcomes of an experiment  
**Sample Point:** just one of the possible outcomes  
**Event:** one **or more** outcomes of an experiment

Example: the chances of a "double" when rolling 2 dice.  
**Sample Space:** Possible outcomes. **36** **sample points**  
                           {1,1} {1,2} {1,3} {1,4} ... {6,3} {6,4} {6,5} {6,6}

**Event:** Looking for double. Event is made up of **6** **sample points.**  
                           {1,1} {2,2} {3,3} {4,4} {5,5} and {6,6}  
****  
Run 100 **Experiments**, and find how many **Events** you observe.
