# Random Variables

## **Discrete and Continuous Random Variables**

A **variable** is a quantity whose value changes. If the value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon, the variable is called **random variable** denoted by a **capital letter.**

### **Discrete variable** 

* Variable whose value is obtained by counting
* Has a countable number of possible values
* Representation: **Histogram**
* Example: number of students present, number of heads when flipping three coins

### **Continuous variable** 

* Variable whose value is obtained by measuring
* Takes all values in a given interval of numbers
* Representation: **Density Curve**
* The probability that X is between an interval of numbers is the area under the density curve between the interval endpoints
* Examples:  height of students in class,  time it takes to get to school
