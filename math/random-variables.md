# Random Variables

## **Discrete and Continuous Random Variables**

A **variable** is a quantity whose value changes. If the value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon, the variable is called **random variable** denoted by a **capital letter.**

### **Discrete variable** 

* Variable whose value is obtained by counting
* Has a countable number of possible values
* Representation: **Histogram**
* Example: number of students present, number of heads when flipping three coins

### **Continuous variable** 

* Variable whose value is obtained by measuring
* Takes all values in a given interval of numbers
* Representation: **Density Curve**
* The probability that X is between an interval of numbers is the area under the density curve between the interval endpoints
* Examples:  height of students in class,  time it takes to get to school

## Expectation and Variance

### **Expectation**

* Describes the **average value\(mean\)** of X, written as **E\(X\) or** $$\mu$$
* $$E(X) = \Sigma  xP(x) $$ for discrete random variables

_**What is the expected value when we roll a fair die?**_

* There are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 
* Each of these has a probability of 1/6 of occurring. Let X represent the outcome of the experiment.
* Therefore P\(1\) = 1/6 \(the probability that you throw a 1 is 1/6\)  
  P\(2\) = 1/6   
  P\(3\) = 1/6  
  P\(4\) = 1/6   
  P\(5\) = 1/6  
  P\(6\) = 1/6

  E\(X\) = 1×P\(1\) + 2×P\(2\) + 3×P\(3\) + 4×P\(4\) + 5×P\(5\) + 6×P\(6\) =&gt; 1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 + 4/6 + 5/6 + 6/6 =&gt; 7/2 =&gt; 3.5

* Expectation is 3.5

### Variance

* Describes the **spread** \(amount of variability\) around the expectation, written as Var\(X\)
* \*\*\*\*$$Var(X) = E[ (X – \mu )^2 ] = E(X^2) -\mu ^2 $$ ****
  * $$\mu : Expectation/mean$$
  * $$E(X^2): \Sigma  x^2P(x) $$
* **Note: Standard deviation** $$\sigma$$ is the square root of **variance**
